This document outlines and prioritizes desired functionality that the Open
Web Platform should provide in the area of Web Payments. The purpose of this
document is to provide future W3C Working Groups with specific requirements
and functionality that should be achievable with new features that they 
add to the Open Web Platform.

    <p> 
This document is a work in progress and is being released early and often
using an agile process; it is incomplete.
    </p>
The Web Payments IG has only had the opportunity to review a handful of the
40+ use cases, 120+ requirements, and hundreds of pages of
payments research submitted to the group via various other standards group
output such as ISO20022, research documents from X9 and the US Federal Reserve, 
documents from the Web Payments Community Group, and input from the 
general public. Expect this document to be rapidly iterated upon.

    <h2>High Priority Use Cases</h2> 
    <p>
The following use cases have been identified by the Web Payments Interest
Group as high-priority items.
    </p>
    
    <section>
      <h3>Purchase Request</h3>
      <p>
A buyer selects a product or service to purchase on a website. The website 
generates a payment request that is sent to the buyer's payment processor 
for processing.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Customer POV: Penny logs into the HobbyCo website, providing her payment 
processor credential in the process. Penny selects a model train for purchase. 
The store generates a payment request which is then forwarded to her preferred 
payment processor.
          </li>
          <li>
Merchant POV: A FarmCo customer selects a 10 kg bag of grass seed for purchase. 
FarmCo performs a few database lookups to determine the current market price 
of grass seed and generates an invoice for the purchase of the selected 
product. The invoice is transmitted to the customer's Payment Agent, which 
then transmits the invoice to the customer's payment processor for processing.
          </li>
          <li>
Payment Processor POV: A PayCo customer receives a payment request to send 
funds to RetailCo. Upon approval by the customer, the transmission of funds 
are initiated from the customer's financial account to RetailCo's 
financial account.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h4>Details</h4>
        <p>
All payments start somewhere and they typically follow the same basic flow: 
1) a payer requests a product or service, 2) the payee advertises the final 
price for the product or service, and 3) the payer initiates payment to the 
payee. This use case explores the initiation of a payment from the customer, 
merchant, and payment processor perspectives. 
        </p>
        <p>
A payment request contains all of the details necessary to perform a purchase 
including: 1) an optional list of requested products or services,
2) the exchange value (price) for the products/services, 3) the acceptable 
payment instruments, and 4) a cryptographically verifiable signature on 
the important data in the request. The payment request is an extensible, 
cryptographically verifiable, self-contained document that can be used 
interchangeably with any payment processor.
        </p>
      </section>
        
      <section>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
A messaging format that can encapsulate a list of goods and services being 
sold and the current value required to acquire the goods and services. 
          </li>
          <li>
The messaging format should be extensible (e.g. Linked Data, JSON-LD). 
          </li>
          <li>
The messaging format should be cryptographically verifiable (e.g. via 
digital signatures, PKI).
          </li>
          <li>
The messaging format should enable the receiver of funds to specify 
acceptable payment instruments.
          </li>
          <li>
A protocol that is capable of transmitting the payment request from the 
origination point of the payment request to the payer's payment processor.
          </li>
          <li>
A protocol that is capable of discovering the payer's payment processor(s).
          </li>
          <li>
A protocol that is capable of discovering the payer's payment instrument(s).
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Choice of Payment Instrument</h3>
      <p>
When a payee intends to make a payment, they are given a choice to pick among 
the intersection of the payment instruments they have available to them and 
the payment instruments that are accepted by the merchant/payee.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Daniel wants to pay the taxi fare with his credit card. The cab company promotes
the payment via its web site which offers, on Daniel's smartphone, to choose 
between several instruments offering different payment means: 1) the basic 
credit card (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) channel; 2) or an indirect aggregators 
(PayPal, Google checkout); 3) or the personal wallet detected as available on 
Daniel's phone.
          </li>
          <li>
Amantha downloads the latest version of her favorite game. It's only a couple 
of euros that she'd like to pay on top of her telecom operator's bill. The game 
store web site accepts payment via credit card and operator billing. Amantha 
selects the "operator billing" payment option.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h4>Details</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Each payment instrument is registered with a set of attributes in order to 
filter, sort, and display them. 
          </li>
          <li>
Each payment processor is registered and 'subscribes' to a the payment 
instrument it is able to provide.
          </li>
          <li>
Each merchant provides a list of acceptable payment instruments.
          </li>
          <li>
Over time, each buyer iteratively builds a list of preferred payment 
instruments for their commonly used merchants.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
        
      <section>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
The browser and the host are able to negotiate a payment instrument with 
respect to their preferences and support capabilities.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h3>Push-based Payments</h3>
      <p>
When a customer wants to make a purchase, the merchant presents the customer 
with an electronic invoice which in turn can be presented to a payment 
processor.  The payment processor then provides a validated proof-of-payment 
to the merchant.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Customer POV: John goes to CandyCart.com and clicks “buy” to purchase 
chocolates. John is redirected to the CandyCart.com’s payment processor's 
website which presents him with a payment UI. John completes the purchase, 
and is redirected to CandyCart.com’s website, to which he can now post a 
digital receipt confirming the purchase.  
          </li>
          <li>
Customer POV: Francis purchases items in a local novelty store.  The store 
system notifies his mobile application what methods of purchase can be used, 
and also sends his mobile application an electronic invoice for the 
transaction.  The mobile app presents Frances with options for payment, and 
Frances chooses to pay with his tokenized credit card.  The token and invoice 
are sent to the payment processor from the mobile app.  The payment processor 
responds with a signed proof of payment electronic document.
          </li>
          <li>
Merchant POV: A customer scans or clicks 5 items to purchase.  The merchant 
system presents an electronic invoice (either total only or with a breakdown 
of the transaction), including the merchant's identifier, to the customer's 
device.  The customer's device returns a digest of the invoice, having been 
created with the payment processor's private key.
          </li>
          <li>
Payment Processor POV: A customer sends an electronic invoice, including 
the merchant and customer identifiers, to the payment processor.  The payment 
processor checks the customer and merchant for validity, posts the requested 
amount to the merchant's acquirer, which returns a digest on the 
merchant/customer/amount/time tuple for proof of payment.  The payment 
processor then returns a signed digest of the invoice plus the acquirer 
digest proving payment to the customer's device, which it in turn posts to 
the merchant system to prove payment.  
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h4>Details</h4>
        <p>
For this use case, the customer asks the payment processor for payment 
directly, preventing the need for sensitive customer information to be shared 
with the merchant, keeping the merchant out of "PCI scope."  No direct 
communication between merchant and payment provider is required for this use 
case. It may be possible to create an electronic receipt format that satisfies 
the requirements for this use case as well as others. 
        </p>
      </section>
        
      <section>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
All acquirers must have an available public key.
          </li>
          <li>
All payment processors must have an available public key.
          </li>
          <li>
All merchants must have a global identifier.
          </li>
          <li>
All customers must be recognized by the payment processor. 
          </li>
        </ul>
